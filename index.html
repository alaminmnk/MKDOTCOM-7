<h2> <b>A planned cage fight between tech leaders Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg could now take place in Italy, and have an ancient Rome theme.</b> </h2>

   <h3> <i>In the story's latest twist, Italy's culture minister on Friday said that he had spoken to Mr Musk about hosting the showdown as a charity event.
    
    The billionaire CEOs of Tesla and Meta (formerly Facebook) have been goading each other into the fight since June.<br>
    
    If it goes ahead, millions are expected to be donated to children's hospitals.<br>
    
    However, Mr Zuckerberg has said no date has been agreed so far.
    
    Detailing his vision on<b> social media platform X </b>(previously known as Twitter), Mr Musk said he had spoken to both Italy's prime minister and its culture minister.<br>
    
    "They have agreed on an epic location," he wrote. "Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all."<br>
    
    However the capital Rome, and its iconic Colosseum - where legendary Gladiator fights were held in ancient times - have been ruled out.<br>
    
    Italy's Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said in a statement that the "great charity" event would resonate with the country's historical significance while also preserving its cultural heritage.<br>
    
    "I had a long and friendly conversation with Elon Musk, we talked about our shared passion for ancient Roman history," Mr Sangiuliano said in a statement.<br>
    
    "We are thinking about how to organise a great charity and historical evocation event, respecting, and fully protecting the setting... It will not take place in Rome."<br>
    
    Mr Sangiuliano also said that a "substantial amount, many millions of euros" is expected to be donated to two Italian children's hospitals as a result of hosting the cage match.<br>
    
    Writing on Threads, the platform seen as a direct competitor to X, which he launched last month, Mark Zuckerberg said he has "been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me", and if a date was ever agreed, "you'll hear it from me".<br>
    
    "Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on."
    
    Seeming to take a dig at the floated plans, Mr Zuckerberg said that when he competes, he wants "to do it in a way that puts a spotlight on the elite athletes at the top of the game".<br>
    
    "You do that by working with professional (organisations) like the UFC or ONE [mixed martial arts organisations] to pull this off well and create a great card," he said.<br>
    
    Elon Musk, 52, and Mark Zuckerberg, 39 are two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires.
    
    The bizarre idea to fight each other started in June, when Mr Musk tweeted that he was "up for a cage fight" with Mr Zuckerberg.<br>
    
    The Meta CEO, who already has mixed martial arts (MMA) training and has recently won jiu-jitsu tournaments, simply responded with "send me location".</i></h3>
